# Statement about Accuracy of the Data Qouted From https://www.gov.uk/guidance/access-fuel-price-data
We recognise the interim scheme is limited and there will sometimes be a delay between the setting of prices, the publication of price data, and the prices being available in third-party apps. Customers should always check the price displayed at the forecourt before purchasing road fuel.
